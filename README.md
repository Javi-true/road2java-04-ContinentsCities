# Continents Program

This project is designed to practice Java programming concepts, particularly focusing on the use of `switch` statements and object-oriented principles. The program takes a predefined `continent` value and identifies a key city within that continent.

## Key Concepts Practiced:
1. **Instance Fields:**  
   The class `Continents` has an instance field `continent`, which is used to store the continent number. In this case, the value is set to `4`, representing Africa.

2. **Switch Statement:**  
   The `continentIdentification()` method uses a `switch` statement to map the `continent` field to a specific city. Each case corresponds to a different continent, and depending on the value of `continent`, the program returns a string with the continent name and a major city.

3. **Object Creation:**  
   In the `main` method, an instance of the `Continents` class is created. The `continentIdentification()` method is then called to output the corresponding city for the given continent value.

4. **Constructor Method:**  
   The program includes a default constructor `Continents()`, though it does not modify any values at object creation.

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to:
- Practice using `switch` statements to handle multiple conditions
- Work with instance fields and methods in a Java class
- Return values from methods based on logic conditions
- Create and manipulate objects in Java
